abstract: This paper evaluates the potential for negative externalities from
  public housing by examining crime rates before and after demolition of public
  housing projects in Chicago between 1995 and 2010. Using data on block-level
  crimes by type of crime merged to detailed geographic data on individual
  public housing demolitions, I find evidence that Chicago's public housing
  imposed significant externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. Using a
  difference in difference approach comparing neighborhoods around public
  housing projects to nearby neighborhoods I find that crime decreases by 8.8%
  after a demolition. This decrease is concentrated in violent crime. I use an
  event study to show that the decrease occurs at the approximate date of the
  eviction of the residents and persists for at least 5 years after the
  demolition. Neighborhoods with large demolitions and demolitions of public
  housing that had been poorly maintained display the largest crime decreases.
