abstract: We contribute to the literature on diversity in the economics
  profession, which has mostly focused on academia, by providing a first look at
  the employment and earnings of federal government economists by gender and
  race. Combining micro-level data on federal workers with information on their
  earnings in federal and private sector jobs, we examine the share of federal
  government economists by race and gender, earnings differences by race and
  gender, and whether earning gaps differ during their federal government
  tenure.
