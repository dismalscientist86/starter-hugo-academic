abstract: Event study is a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamic effects of
  policy and other shocks in microeconomics. However, there is little
  understanding of how to apply this method when individuals or locations
  experience multiple events in close succession. We explore methods of
  estimating a multiple event study with Monte Carlo simulations. Allowing
  multiple event-time dummies to be turned on at once generally produces
  unbiased estimates, while ignoring subsequent events or duplicating
  observations to have one observation per individual-event-time create trends
  in the outcome variable before and after an event that can be misleading to
  the researcher. We present empirical applications which show that the choice
  of method can make important differences in practice.
