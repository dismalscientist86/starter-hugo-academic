abstract: We examine the long-term outcomes for a population of teenage mothers
  who give birth to their children around the end of high school. We compare the
  mothers whose high school education was interrupted by childbirth (because the
  child was born before her expected graduation date) with mothers who did not
  experience the same disruption to their education. We find that mothers who
  gave birth during the school year are 5.4 percentage points less likely to
  complete their high school education, are less likely to be married, and have
  more children than their counterparts who gave birth just a few months later.
  The wages for these two sets of teenage mothers are not statistically
  different, but with a lower likelihood of marriage and more children, the
  households of the treated mothers are more likely to fall below the poverty
  threshold. Although differences in educational attainment have narrowed over
  time, the differences in labor market outcomes and family structure have
  remained stable.
