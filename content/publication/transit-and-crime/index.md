abstract: We test whether public transit access affects crime using a novel 
identification strategy based on temporary, maintenance-related closures of 
stations in the Washington, DC rail transit system. The closures generate 
plausibly exogenous variation in transit access across space and time, allowing 
us to test the popular notion that crime can be facilitated by public transit. 
Closing one station reduces crime by 5% in the vicinity of stations on the 
same train line. Most of this effect remains after controlling for decreased 
ridership, indicating that a decrease in the availability of victims does not 
drive most of our results. We find suggestive evidence that crime falls more 
at stations that tend to import crime, i.e. stations where perpetrators are 
less likely to live. We also see larger decreases at stations on the same line 
when the transit authority closes stations that tend to export crime. These 
heterogeneous effects suggest that the response of perpetrators to increased 
transportation costs contributes to the decrease in crime.
