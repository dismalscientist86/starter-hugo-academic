  We test whether public transit access affects crime using a novel
  identification strategy based on temporary, maintenance-related closures of
  stations in the Washington, DC rail transit system. The closures generate
  plausibly exogenous variation in transit access across space and time,
  allowing us to test the popular notion that crime can be facilitated by public
  transit. Closing one station reduces crime by 5% in the vicinity of stations
  on the same train line. Most of this effect remains after controlling for
  decreased ridership, indicating that a decrease in the availability of victims
  does not drive most of our results. We find suggestive evidence that crime
  falls more at stations that tend to import crime, i.e. stations where
  perpetrators are less likely to live. We also see larger decreases at stations
  on the same line when the transit authority closes stations that tend to
  export crime. These 

  heterogeneous effects suggest that the response of perpetrators to increased transportation costs contributes to the decrease in crime.
