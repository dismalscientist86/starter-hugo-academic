abstract: This paper evaluates the potential for negative externalities 
from public housing by examining crime rates before and after demolition 
of public housing projects in Chicago between 1995 and 2010. Using data on 
block-level crimes by type of crime merged to detailed geographic data on 
individual public housing demolitions, I find evidence that Chicago's public 
housing imposed significant externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. 
Using a difference in difference approach comparing neighborhoods around 
public housing projects to nearby neighborhoods I find that crime decreases 
by 8.8% after a demolition. This decrease is concentrated in violent crime. 
I use an event study to show that the decrease occurs at the approximate date 
of the eviction of the residents and persists for at least 5 years after the 
demolition. Neighborhoods with large demolitions and demolitions of public 
housing that had been poorly maintained display the largest crime decreases.
